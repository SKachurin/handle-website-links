# handle-website-links

If you need to handle links within large app this might come in handy.

This simple script handles all links in your app:
Internal links will be opened in the same window.
External links - in a new window.

You can put it in your footer file or your layout file

Please do not forget to replace <kbd>YourDomainName</kbd> with your domain name (ex: <kbd>example.com</kbd>) 
and to replace <kbd>NumberOfSymbols</kbd> with actual number of symbols in your domain name (ex: for example.com it would be <kbd>11</kbd>).
